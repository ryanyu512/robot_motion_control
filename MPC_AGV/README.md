This project utilizes model predictive control (MPC) to achieve lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. In highways or even in warehouse settings, it is usual that a robot needs to shift to another lane in order to avoid a serious collision. 

1. demo.py: used for testing different parameters of MPC
2. ref_gen.py: generate references for motion control
3. robot.py: define the properties of 2d vehicle
4. robot_base.py: define the physical constants of 2d vechicle
5. sim.py: custom function for running simulation
