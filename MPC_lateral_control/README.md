This project explores combines noisy sensors (i.e. gyroscope, GPS and lidar) and particle filter to estimate the pose of (x, y, heading and forward velocity) 2D vehicle. The above shows the short demo of particle filter. 'green dot' represents true state of robot, 'yellow dot' represents averaged particle filters, 'x' represents noisy gps signal and 'blue small dot' represents point clouds generated by lidar. 

1. demo.py: used for testing different parameters of kalman filter
2. sensor.py: define the properties of different sensors
3. robot.py: define the properties of 2d vehicle
4. sim.py: custom function for running simulation
5. utility.py: provide custom tools
